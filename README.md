USE THE LATEST RELEASES FOR THE MOD, CLONING WILL GIVE YOU A VERSION WITH INCOMPLETE FEATURES AND LOTS OF BUGS

If you want to use the Dev menu which is included in this mod, open Origin, set your Titanfall 2 Launch properties to: 

'-dev +developer 1'

Most parts of the menu still don't work, I'll probably be slowly adding more support for it in future patches. But RN all the start points work. Go try That!

Currently the mod is still in development, planned features may change or be removed entirely.

Please do not try to incorperate any of this directly from me in your own mod, I'll let you know whenever this is done but for now while its in development give me time to polish things.
